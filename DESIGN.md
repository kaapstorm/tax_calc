The tax rate on dividends
-------------------------

The formula for calculating the tax rate on dividends in the UK for the
2025/26 tax year involves applying your income tax band after
considering your personal allowance and dividend allowance. The
dividend allowance is £500, after which dividend income is taxed at
different rates depending on your income band:

$$
\text{Dividend Tax} =
\begin{cases}
8.75\% & \text{if total taxable income is within the basic rate band (£12,571–£50,270)} \\
33.75\% & \text{if within the higher-rate band (£50,271–£125,140)} \\
39.35\% & \text{if within the additional-rate band (over £125,140)}
\end{cases}
$$

> [!NOTE]
> The first £500 of dividend income each tax year is tax-free due to
> the dividend allowance. Any above this is taxed according to the above
> rates. Your tax band is determined by your total income
> (wages + dividends + other taxable income) minus your Personal
> Allowance (typically £12,570 per year).[1][3][7][9][10]

### Worked Example

Suppose you earn £32,570 in total income, including £3,000 in
dividends.

- Subtract the Personal Allowance (£12,570): £32,570 - £12,570 =
  £20,000 (taxable income).

- The first £500 of dividend income is tax-free.

- The remaining £2,500 is taxed at 8.75%, because the total taxable
  income falls within the basic rate band.[7]

### Summary Formula

$$
\text{Taxable Dividends} = \text{Total Dividends} - £500
$$
$$
\text{Dividend Tax Owed} = (\text{Taxable Dividends in Band}) \times \text{Band Rate}
$$

Where Band Rate is one of 8.75%, 33.75%, or 39.35%, depending on the
Income Tax band you occupy based on total income after allowances.[3]

The tax rate on wages
---------------------

The formula used to calculate the tax rate on wages in the UK depends on
where you live, as Scotland has a different set of rates and bands
compared to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In both systems, you
first subtract your Personal Allowance (£12,570 for 2025/26) from your
total income, then apply the appropriate tax rates to the remaining
taxable income.

### England, Wales, Northern Ireland (2025/26)

$$
\text{Taxable Income} = \text{Total Income} - £12,570
$$

- 20% on taxable income up to £37,700
- 40% on income from £37,701 to £125,140
- 45% on income over £125,140

So, in formula:

$$
\text{Income Tax Owed (non-Scotland)} =
\begin{cases}
0\% & £0 \leq \text{Total Income} \leq £12,570 \\
20\% & £12,571 \leq \text{Taxable Income} \leq £37,700 \\
40\% & £37,701 \leq \text{Taxable Income} \leq £125,140 \\
45\% & \text{Taxable Income} > £125,140 \\
\end{cases}
$$

(Personal Allowance may be reduced by £1 for every £2 earned over
£100,000, and lost entirely over £125,140).[1][2][3][4][5]

### Scotland (2025/26)

$$
\text{Taxable Income} = \text{Total Income} - £12,570
$$

- 19% on income up to £2,827
- 20% from £2,828 to £14,921
- 21% from £14,922 to £31,092
- 42% from £31,093 to £62,430
- 45% from £62,431 to £125,140
- 48% on income above £125,140

So, in formula:

$$
\text{Income Tax Owed (Scotland)} =
\begin{cases}
0\% & £0 \leq \text{Total Income} \leq £12,570 \\
19\% & £12,571 \leq \text{Taxable Income} \leq £2,827 \\
20\% & £2,828 \leq \text{Taxable Income} \leq £14,921 \\
21\% & £14,922 \leq \text{Taxable Income} \leq £31,092 \\
42\% & £31,093 \leq \text{Taxable Income} \leq £62,430 \\
45\% & £62,431 \leq \text{Taxable Income} \leq £125,140 \\
48\% & \text{Taxable Income} > £125,140 \\
\end{cases}
$$
(The Personal Allowance and tapering at high incomes work similarly to the rest of the UK).[2][4][5][1]

### Key Differences

- **Scotland** uses more tax bands and higher top rates on higher
  incomes.[5][1][2]

- All UK regions share the same personal allowance (£12,570 for most
  people).[4][1][2][5]

- Incomes above £100,000 reduce the personal allowance by £1 for every
  £2 above the threshold, removing it entirely at £125,140.[3][2][4]
